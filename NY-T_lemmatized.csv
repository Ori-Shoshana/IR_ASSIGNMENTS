host it so if you be in the area or visit we would love to see you there ok on with today  show from the new york times I be sabrina tavernise and this be the daily music play in an unexpected speech last week president biden reveal the detail of a secret proposal intend to end the war in gaza most surprising be where that proposal have come from today my colleague isabel kershner explain biden  gambit and the difficult choice it present for israel  leader benjamin netanyahu it be wednesday june isabel tell we about this speech from president biden last friday at the white house so last friday president biden make a speech and it come at a pivotal moment in the war because for week beforehand the whole world have be focus on israel  long delay invasion of the city of rafah the southernmost city in the gaza strip and also the city that about a displace palestinians have flee to to find refuge from fight in other area of the gaza strip so understandably there be huge concern internationally and particularly a lot of pressure come from the white house for israel not to go into rafah it be just consider way too risky but for the israelis they be say the last battalion of hama be there many hostage be there and without take control of that area the israelis feel they would not have accomplish anything so in the end they do begin to move into the eastern part of rafah but then as the israelis be operate in eastern rafah with their tank and ground troop the israelis on may carry out a strike an airstrike this be an attack mean to target hamas operative and they do in fact strike those operative and kill they with what they say be the small missile that their jet could carry unfortunately that strike then set off an absolutely devastating fire because the area the strike take place in be right by a camp of makeshift shack and tent where hundred or thousand of palestinians be shelter this fire rip through the tent and end up kill civilian accord to the gazan health authority and it be exactly the kind of disaster that everybody have fear if israel be to operate in this crowd southern dusty border town which presumably put a lot more pressure on the biden white house to do something about this war that be right now we know that the white house the biden administration would very much like to see this war come to an end as soon as possible and then on friday good afternoon before I begin my remark president biden give a speech and surprisingly now to another issue this speech when it turn to the israel hamas war be not about rafah in fact it be something totally different and much big israel have now offer israel be offer a comprehensive new proposal it be a road map to an endure ceasefire and the release of all hostage what president biden describe as the outline of an israeli proposal for a ceasefire truce and hostage release deal with hama that would end the war this proposal have be transmit by qatar to hamas today I want to lay out his term for the american citizen and for the world and isabel what do he mean exactly by the israeli proposal well there be be a lot of smoke and mirror around this whole process of talk and negotiation between israel and hamas and in fact the last time we see a negotiation actually result in a temporary cease fire and a partial hostage release be at the end of last november but in fact there have be this on again off again attempt at get negotiation back on track over the last few week and it soon come to light that this be the late israeli proposal that be apparently present and this proposal it turn out be unanimously approve as a basis for the negotiation by israel  war cabinet and here be an american president spell out this previously undisclosed israeli position on television absolutely and the israeli public know nothing about this so what do biden actually say what do he say be in this proposal ok well what he say this new proposal have phase he present it as a deal in phase which be generally in line with all the previous plan of the last few month and the phase would involve a week temporary ceasefire during which a certain number of hostage include woman the elderly the wound the most vulnerable one there be american hostage who would be release at this stage and we want they home would be exchange for hundred of palestinian prisoner in israeli jail and israeli force would be withdraw from population center within the gaza strip with truck carry aid into gaza every single day humanitarian aid would be flow at a much great level and generally the beginning of a change in atmosphere and climate so this seem in some way like the temporary ceasefire in november right woman and child vulnerable hostage a cease in hostility for week what about phase well here we get to the crucial part because during phase the side be suppose to start negotiate phase now I will be straight with you there be a number of detail to negotiate to move from phase to phase and phase be suppose to culminate in all remain live hostage release and exchange again for many more palestinian prisoner from israeli jail this would involve also the withdrawal of israeli troop from the gaza strip and in his speech president biden do say that as long as hamas live up to its commitment the temporary ceasefire would become in the word of the israeli proposal the cessation of hostility permanently essentially mean the end of the war so biden be actually talk about the end of the war he be say that out loud which be not something we have be hear from israel at all at least publicly on the contrary in fact our colleague write a story at the end of last week when senior israeli official say the war would last until at least the end of the year so this be something very new absolutely and then we get to phase because there be a phase to this plan and that be move ahead already to the day after the war which have be keep very vague by the israelis up to now and the phase that president biden outline be essentially just for a major reconstruction plan for gaza that be the offer that be now on the table and what we have be ask for it be what we need so the president be say that this be a deal that should be accept that meet the requirement of both side that can point to a path forward and he make a couple of point to bolster that the people of israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security because they have devastate hamas force of which be that in his view hamas have already be sufficiently degraded and devastate to the point where as president biden put it hamas be no long capable of carry out another october in other word that goal of total victory that netanyahu talk about biden be actually say they have accomplish it the israelis have accomplish it not really actually he take on netanyahu on the total victory slogan indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory will not bring israel and will not bring down will only bog down israel in gaza drain the economic military and human resource and further israel  isolation in the world and say that total victory be a kind of nebulous and unrealistic goal that would basically mean indefinite war because what do total victory mean you can not kill every last hamas operative and even if you do presumably there would be many more palestinian who would come to replace they and in a way he be use this speech to go over the head of netanyahu and go straight to the israeli people and present they with these term to in a way corner netanyahu but also to put down the gauntlet to hamas and say here be the term they sound very like the term hamas be ask for and put hamas equally on the spot to come back to the table even though israel be still fight in rafah it be time to begin this new stage for the hostage to come home for israel to be secure for the suffering to stop it be time for this war to end for the day after to begin thank you very much so biden be essentially say here listen israel you have win the war effectively hamas be degraded now it be time to accept the ceasefire deal that you yourself have design what be the reaction inside israel the initial reaction take a while to come because president biden make his speech and it land at about in the evening on friday israel time and this be the time where many many family be sit around their sabbath dinner table as I be with my family and friend not watch the news not look at phone for the most part observant jews have actually switch off for the sabbath and be not go to hear any news until saturday night and as the news do begin to trickle out it really shake israel up and this leave netanyahu in a great bind because for month he be really be play for time and juggle compete interest and really not have to make a decision way or the other on what come next we have be hear that rafah be really the last stronghold of hamas and this be something the military have to do but after that there be just a kind of void and no news on the hostage or a ceasefire or a deal on the horizon and so when this speech be make suddenly it shake up everything and netanyahu be suddenly face a very crucial choice we will be right back so isabel you say that this be a very important moment for netanyahu that now he really be face a choice what do he do what do he come out and say so his office actually put out a statement and his response be that israel be stick to its objective of the destruction of hamas  military and govern capability and he say the actual proposal put forward by israel would allow israel to uphold these principle now this be a slightly ambiguous response that you could pass in different way he be not exactly deny that this be an israeli proposal and indeed we quickly learn that in fact israel  war cabinet have unanimously vote on the general outline of what president biden have present he be not deny it but the thing miss from that statement be this declaration we would be hear for month on end that the war would not end until there be total victory that have go so total victory have go which be a difference which mean potentially the war goal have shift a little bit well the way he articulate it be talk about the degradation or dismantling of hama  capability as oppose to talk about the total elimination of hamas as a movement and then he follow up his office put out another statement on saturday also still during the sabbath which be a little strong he say under the proposal israel would insist on its condition be meet these same war objective before a permanent cease fire be put in place and that any suggestion that israel would agree to that permanent ceasefire before the condition be meet would be a non starter but again it be kind of conditional and could be interpret in different way at what point do declare that the capability have be dismantle or sufficiently degraded so it leave a lot of room for maneuver and so what be netanyahu up to here isabel I think he be try to balance all these compete side he be seem to be try not to torpedo the chance of this deal but at the same time to be able to hang on politically when he have a very serious challenge loom within his government should this deal go ahead so tell I about that challenge israel  government be form of a coalition of party netanyahu  likud be the main party but it totally rely for its majority in parliament on its partner in the coalition and they include ultra orthodox party and far right party and the far right party have both come out explicitly say that should this deal as outline by president biden go ahead they will not be party to it so netanyahu face this real political danger on his right that be right so there be the leader of these right wing party who he rely on for his coalition government he rely on they for his majority in parliament and the leader of those party be itamar ben gvir who be the national security minister and bezalel smotrich who be currently the finance minister now neither of these party nor their leader be sit in the much more tight and small war cabinet that actually oversee and direct and make the decision on the course of the war in gaza they be see as way too extreme to be part of that forum that forum be much more reflective of the national consensus but these party be part of the broad government and they have threaten not only to oppose the deal as outline by president biden should it go ahead but they have actually vow if it do go ahead they would withdraw their support to netanyahu and bring his government down and if his government be to collapse as a result he would then be face a new election now he have be try to stave off the end of the war and the prospect of new election ever since october because then he be in danger of face that public reckoning for the perceive failure that the government  policy failure the military  failure the intelligence failure lead up to the hamas lead attack of october the but we really might be get to crunch time when it come to his political lifeline here so this be a pretty dramatic moment for netanyahu then right I mean he be under tremendous pressure from biden his big ally biden be basically ask he to choose between this deal which mean the end of the war something his coalition partner these hard right guy really do not want and his own power essentially right stay alive politically or the end of the war and the hostage come home that be a very stark choice absolutely and then there be other choice that he have to weigh because israel have be increasingly isolate and under international censure for its prosecution of the war in gaza netanyahu himself be face the prospect of possible arrest warrant be put out against he from the international criminal court in the hague israel be in the dark on a genocide case in the international court of justice in the hague so should he go ahead with this deal he have be offer sweetener like an invitation to address congress and this would in a way be a way of bring he back into the fold so isabel say netanyahu approve this proposal how likely be it that the right wing smotrich and ben gvir actually do leave the government I mean they would be give up power too no they would and if we look at all the opinion poll be do in israel in the last few month bezalel smotrich and his religious zionism party for would barely scrape back into parliament in another election and therefore there be a lot at stake for he too and for itamar ben gvir because if the next government that be form be not go to be a right wing and far right government he would find himself out of power too but isabel let us say they do leave what happen in that scenario well the assumption be that the government would collapse it would lose its majority and naturally the knesset would vote to dissolve itself and set a date for a new election which would have to come within month and during that period this government would turn into a caretaker government now usually a caretaker government that be a transitional in that period before election be not suppose to make dramatic decision for the country but be a caretaker government during wartime this put israel in uncharted political territory then theoretically if we be to ask could such a government even approve a deal once it have be negotiate even without the support of those far right party apparently there would still be enough in favor to see it through interesting so it seem like there be a lot of possibility for how this could go but it do in a way rely on netanyahu decide what israel  course will be and it seem like he probably need to land on of these option what do you think he be go to do well it might not end up be black and white take the deal or not take the deal we might end up see something in between because I think netanyahu who be face huge public pressure to bring back those hostage who still be alive would definitely want to move ahead with at least that part of the deal that would see a week temporary ceasefire in return for the most vulnerable hostage and then you get into the much tricky part of that negotiation for the next stage which would involve essentially end the war and it could be that we might see netanyahu want to proceed with this deal but only partially and then get to a point where it can not go far and netanyahu be probably very keenly aware of the american political timetable there be skeptic here who say that by labor day all the american attention be go to be focus on america  own internal politic run up to the november election and that netanyahu basically just have to survive another day to get to that point at which point the pressure subside so this be a scenario in which he just basically run out the clock he keep on that tightrope that be a possibility absolutely and that he would be very adept at do if the past be anything to go by ok so there be a number of way netanyahu could actually handle this how should we think about what biden have really accomplish here well I think it be hard to say that speech be go to change the course or the outcome of this war but it certainly have crystallize the issue and bring they out into the light after month and month of murkiness that netanyahu be able to in a way hide behind and operate within and I think now he be in the spotlight and assume that hamas be willing to accept and go along with this negotiation for this proposal the israeli public  expectation have certainly be rise now toward a deal and all eye be now on netanyahu to see which way he will go isabel thank you thank you so much in an interview with time magazine publish on tuesday biden be ask whether netanyahu be prolong the war in gaza in an effort to hold on to office biden say quote there be every reason for people to draw that conclusion we will be right back here be what else you should know today on tuesday republican lawmaker in arizona vote to put a ballot measure before voter in november that would make unlawfully cross the border from mexico a crime in the state the move would put the border crisis directly onto the ballot in a key swing state potentially fire up anti immigration conservative voter it be similar to a law pass in texas early this year currently hold up in court after it be challenge by the biden administration and the result of a major election in india have be tally and they be deeply disappointing for india  prime minister narendra modi modi appear to have secure a consecutive term in office however his bjp party do not deliver the

music play in an unexpected speech last week president biden reveal the detail of a secret proposal intend to end the war in gaza most surprising be where that proposal have come from today my colleague isabel kershner explain biden  gambit and the difficult choice it present for israel  leader benjamin netanyahu it be wednesday june isabel tell we about this speech from president biden last friday at the white house so last friday president biden make a speech and it come at a pivotal moment in the war because for week beforehand the whole world have be focus on israel  long delay invasion of the city of rafah the southernmost city in the gaza strip and also the city that about a displace palestinians have flee to to find refuge from fight in other area of the gaza strip so understandably there be huge concern internationally and particularly a lot of pressure come from the white house for israel not to go into rafah it be just consider way too risky but for the israelis they be say the last battalion of hama be there many hostage be there and without take control of that area the israelis feel they would not have accomplish anything so in the end they do begin to move into the eastern part of rafah but then as the israelis be operate in eastern rafah with their tank and ground troop the israelis on may carry out a strike an airstrike this be an attack mean to target hamas operative and they do in fact strike those operative and kill they with what they say be the small missile that their jet could carry unfortunately that strike then set off an absolutely devastating fire because the area the strike take place in be right by a camp of makeshift shack and tent where hundred or thousand of palestinians be shelter this fire rip through the tent and end up kill civilian accord to the gazan health authority and it be exactly the kind of disaster that everybody have fear if israel be to operate in this crowd southern dusty border town which presumably put a lot more pressure on the biden white house to do something about this war that be right now we know that the white house the biden administration would very much like to see this war come to an end as soon as possible and then on friday good afternoon before I begin my remark president biden give a speech and surprisingly now to another issue this speech when it turn to the israel hamas war be not about rafah in fact it be something totally different and much big israel have now offer israel be offer a comprehensive new proposal it be a road map to an endure ceasefire and the release of all hostage what president biden describe as the outline of an israeli proposal for a ceasefire truce and hostage release deal with hama that would end the war this proposal have be transmit by qatar to hamas today I want to lay out his term for the american citizen and for the world and isabel what do he mean exactly by the israeli proposal well there be be a lot of smoke and mirror around this whole process of talk and negotiation between israel and hamas and in fact the last time we see a negotiation actually result in a temporary cease fire and a partial hostage release be at the end of last november but in fact there have be this on again off again attempt at get negotiation back on track over the last few week and it soon come to light that this be the late israeli proposal that be apparently present and this proposal it turn out be unanimously approve as a basis for the negotiation by israel  war cabinet and here be an american president spell out this previously undisclosed israeli position on television absolutely and the israeli public know nothing about this so what do biden actually say what do he say be in this proposal ok well what he say this new proposal have phase he present it as a deal in phase which be generally in line with all the previous plan of the last few month and the phase would involve a week temporary ceasefire during which a certain number of hostage include woman the elderly the wound the most vulnerable one there be american hostage who would be release at this stage and we want they home would be exchange for hundred of palestinian prisoner in israeli jail and israeli force would be withdraw from population center within the gaza strip with truck carry aid into gaza every single day humanitarian aid would be flow at a much great level and generally the beginning of a change in atmosphere and climate so this seem in some way like the temporary ceasefire in november right woman and child vulnerable hostage a cease in hostility for week what about phase well here we get to the crucial part because during phase the side be suppose to start negotiate phase now I will be straight with you there be a number of detail to negotiate to move from phase to phase and phase be suppose to culminate in all remain live hostage release and exchange again for many more palestinian prisoner from israeli jail this would involve also the withdrawal of israeli troop from the gaza strip and in his speech president biden do say that as long as hamas live up to its commitment the temporary ceasefire would become in the word of the israeli proposal the cessation of hostility permanently essentially mean the end of the war so biden be actually talk about the end of the war he be say that out loud which be not something we have be hear from israel at all at least publicly on the contrary in fact our colleague write a story at the end of last week when senior israeli official say the war would last until at least the end of the year so this be something very new absolutely and then we get to phase because there be a phase to this plan and that be move ahead already to the day after the war which have be keep very vague by the israelis up to now and the phase that president biden outline be essentially just for a major reconstruction plan for gaza that be the offer that be now on the table and what we have be ask for it be what we need so the president be say that this be a deal that should be accept that meet the requirement of both side that can point to a path forward and he make a couple of point to bolster that the people of israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security because they have devastate hamas force of which be that in his view hamas have already be sufficiently degraded and devastate to the point where as president biden put it hamas be no long capable of carry out another october in other word that goal of total victory that netanyahu talk about biden be actually say they have accomplish it the israelis have accomplish it not really actually he take on netanyahu on the total victory slogan indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory will not bring israel and will not bring down will only bog down israel in gaza drain the economic military and human resource and further israel  isolation in the

time for this war to end for the day after to begin thank you very much so biden be essentially say here listen israel you have win the war effectively hamas be degraded now it be time to accept the ceasefire deal that you yourself have design what be the reaction inside israel the initial reaction take a while to come because president biden make his speech and it land at about in the evening on

transcript be create use speech recognition software while it have be review by human transcriber it may contain error please review the episode audio before quote from this transcript and email transcript nytime com with any question from the new york times I be sabrina tavernise and this be the daily late last week an effort to get food into northern gaza turn deadly as thousand of desperate gazan descend on aid truck and israeli troop task with guard those truck open fire but exactly how people die and who be responsible remain contest today my colleague hiba yazbek on what we know about what happen and what it tell we about hunger in gaza it be tuesday march so hiba we be now in the month of israel  war against hamas in gaza and for week we have be hear about negotiation over a cease fire and a hostage exchange then late last week there be a disaster surround an aid convoy that be bring into gaza you have be report on what happen tell we about it so last thursday there be a deadly disaster involve civilian possibly the deadly disaster since the war start nearly month ago in which palestinians be kill and more than be wound in gaza city but there be conflicting report on how they die and what exactly happen the israeli military have account of what happen and the gaza health ministry and witness have another account so my colleague and I start dig into the detail we start call people piece together a picture of what have actually happen there and what do you find when you guy start really look into this so let I just give you the context of what happen this happen in northern gaza the place that have be at war the long that be where israeli ground force begin their invasion of the gaza strip many people have leave the north but we do know that some people be still there the people who have remain there be really live through very desperate condition very little aid have come in to the north of gaza since the war start and especially in recent week food be barely available for the people who have remain there the un have be warn of a famine that be loom over the territory hiba why be there so little aid get into northern gaza in particular well of all there be less aid get into the gaza strip in general not just the north there be multiple reason as to why that be but of the main reason be that israel itself have be very slow to approve permit and often deny permit for aid truck and aid convoy to come in specifically to the north because israel say that they do not want the aid to end up in the hand of hamas that they do not want they to get a hold of the package get it when israel do approve the permit and the aid truck start their journey there be multiple hurdle that they have to go through in order to actually deliver it to the people some of these hurdle include the widespread destruction in gaza there be vast damage across the gaza strip road have be destroy there be rubble everywhere and it be very difficult for the truck to actually move through that rubble and through those road then these aid convoy have to go through multiple israeli checkpoint on the way there be often significant delay at these checkpoint by israeli soldier who be inspect the aid this make it hard for the truck to make it from where they enter in the south all the way to the north in the specific safety window that they be give sometimes they make it halfway through and they turn around because they get delay so much that they can not keep go hm but there be a particular problem with the north where fighting have be go on the long the civil order be now break down essentially we know that frequent israeli strike on palestinian policeman mean that there be really no to run security for official group and for aid convoy leave they vulnerable to attack by local gang who be try to steal the aid and sell it or profit off of it and also hungry and desperate civilian who be try to grab the aid and take as much as they can which mean that they end up steal some of it loot some of it while it be still on the way right so it be lawlessness and effectively social order breakdown I mean this be kind of the downstream effect of extended war in a particular place there be a power vacuum that situation can be very difficult for an organization like the united nations to be able to operate safely right the few aid truck that do come in have have to either suspend their aid delivery into the north or have not be able to deliver aid there the last time unrwa the un agency in charge of palestinian refugee try to bring truck to the north be nearly a month ago but they say that of their convoy come under fire another major aid provider the world food program say that they have not deliver aid there in over week they cite all of the reason we talk about for this suspension so while aid have not be come into the north people have be grow more desperate and hungry and the situation there have be get bad which have be raise international alarm there be be increase call on israel to let aid go through to the north and to alleviate the suffering of the resident there so israel partner with these local palestinian businessman in gaza and they promise to secure the aid convoy that the businessman would supply and that would make their way into the north they successfully do this time last week so people start be very hopeful that more would come and ahead of the delivery they start to gather at this distribution point right outside of gaza city in the north that bring we to thursday  incident music play so last thursday around am around aid truck reach this distribution point they start get close to the crowd of people who have camp there overnight wait for this aid to come when the people see the truck come they be very desperate they surround they they get on top of they then at some point israeli soldier start fire shot then it turn violent very fast it end with palestinians dead and injure this be where the account diverge ok so let us start with the israeli account what do they say happen so the israeli military say that it be try to secure the convoy and it have tank nearby to make sure that the convoy reach the area it do acknowledge that its troop have open fire at the crowd but they say that they open fire when a violent crowd or a violent mob approach their troop and endanger their life they say the shot that be fire be not really the reason why so many people die but the reason that so many people die be because in the chaos of all of it they trample each other and many have die from suffocation or trampling and also that the truck have run over some of the people who be try to run away oh god so the israelis do not deny actually shoot but they say it be more about control the crowd kind of as warn shot type thing and that this be not the way people actually die they say the way people actually die be suffocation or be crush by the aid truck themselves right what do the gazan health authority say so the gazan health authority have actually be call this the flour massacre or the massacre of the hungry stomach because what they be say be that israeli force fire at a crowd of hungry and desperate people who be wait for aid witness and palestinians who be there have say that although some people be trample and possibly run over by the truck that be not the main reason for the high death toll most of the people who be injure or kill be injure and kill by israeli fire so the gazan health authority be essentially say this be a massacre by israel right do we know hiba what actually do happen what have you guy find in your reporting well the israeli military release drone footage that it claim show a mass stampede in which gazan be trample but that video only add to the confusion of the sequence of event the quality and the length of the clip make it more difficult to confirm these claim right it be just grainy there be no sound you see people scramble and run but you do not understand why right the drone footage be heavily edit it leave out key moment but it do show hundred of people circle around the truck and hope to catch a bag of flour then suddenly we see people start to panic and run in multiple direction then they release another clip in which we see israeli tank that be position about a quarter mile down the road then we see about a dozen body lie around they we see people crawl and duck for cover crowd noise but we do have another video that be release by al jazeera gunfire and it show a crowd near the aid convoy and it also capture the sound of gunfire and show multiple tracer round which be a special type of ammunition that help troop fine tune their target when it be dark the tracer round originate from the direction of a nearby israeli military base so although that do not conclude that the shot come from the direction of the israeli military it do add another layer of evidence so hiba it sound like these video be suggestive but not conclusive but what do the people you speak to on the ground say the eyewitness and survivor and doctor you speak with right we speak to witness and survivor as well as doctor at the hospital that have take in the people who be wound and kill they say that most of the people have die or be wound by gunshot the doctor who run of the main hospital in the area that take in the casualty tell I that out of the people who be kill and the people who be wound that the hospital take in all of the injury be of gunshot wound he say that they do not see any injury that coincide with those of a stampede or people be run over by truck that account echo the one that we have hear from witness and people who be there who see people get shoot and fall to the ground next to they but in the chaos of everything people be not check who be dead and who be wound they be just take the flour and they be run for their life and although the account differ on both side what we do know be that many hungry and desperate people die while try to get food and secure aid in a place where famine be loom and starvation be rampant that be what I spend the last few week report on I be try to understand how people in the north of gaza specifically be survive with such little food we will be right back so hiba I want to talk about what people be do to survive in northern gaza but before we get to that what be the big picture on the state of hunger in gaza hunger have reach unprecedented level in gaza and specifically in northern gaza we be start to already see report of child die from malnutrition and dehydration this week the health ministry say that child have die from malnutrition and dehydration at just of northern gaza  hospital wow child have actually die yes we also have the un and aid organization say that in child in northern gaza be acutely malnutritioned and that more than percent of child under be face severe food poverty the un humanitarian coordinator say that a quarter of all gazan resident be step away from famine how exactly be people survive hiba I mean you be talk to people in northern gaza what be they say I have be report on hunger for week I have talk to people about what they be do in order to survive with such little food non english speech non english speech I recently talk to woman whose experience be very typical in northern gaza her name be ghada krayem she be a year old woman from the north who stay in the north and do not flee tell I about ghada non english speech ghada be of kid she have sister and brother she be actually gaza  female solar power engineer she be win many award internationally she be also the sole provider for her family she be use the money that she win from these grant and competition to help her family through this war with that money she actually stockpile a bunch of food in the beginning of the war expect the situation to deteriorate she buy flour and milk and can food and everything they might need they stockpile it in their home how be it that they be still in northern gaza well actually they try to stay in their home for as long as they possibly could until the ground fighting really basically reach their doorstep non english speech at point early on during israel  ground invasion of the north non english speech israeli soldier come to their building and they force they out they ask everyone to leave the building and they detain all of the man and the boy who be later release she be force to leave with nothing they take nothing with they like many other gazan and they move they move time since wow of those time be to the south where they get there and they realize that it actually be not much safe it be not well for they so they realize that they should probably just go back to the north and stay as close as possible to their home in case they be able to go back later but that never happen because israeli force take up their home as a military base and they be there for week she say non english speech after they would leave week later she go back to check on her home it be burn there be nothing leave include the food that she would stockpile now she be shelter with member of her extended family include child in a bedroom apartment in the north people in a bedroom apartment that be extraordinary so what do they do for food early in the war well she tell I that in the beginning of the war they still be able to find some thing to buy and eat like rice and vegetable but non english speech she say that by the end of december basically when aid to the north become less frequent and thing that they be eat have start to run out include flour which become much less available and much more expensive they do not know what to do I mean they have nothing to eat so they start mix water with starch to eat they be have meal a day and the child be constantly hungry so they have to find an alternative that alternative be animal food non english speech so she tell I that they start grind up really any animal food that they could find so rabbit food and bird food and hay and fodder really anything that they could get their hand on they would use that to make bread with but the bread be very dry and it smell bad it taste bad and it make their stomach hurt but she say that the that be the bad for she be the bird food non english speech she say the bird food taste and smell as if you be sit with a bunch of chicken the smell be very bad and the taste be even bad non english speech but she tell I that even though this stuff taste and smell bad they really try to make it as less awful as possible she tell I that of her cousin shelter with she love to bake and she make really tasty sweet before the war so basically she try to make the most out of these ingredient she be make dessert use the corn mill and the rabbit food she be also make other savory dish that they like and they eat frequently before the war non english speech she use the animal feed to make maftoul which be the palestinian version of couscous so she be make it with the ground up animal feed yes but that be still not enough at that point ghada and her family be only eat meal a day and that be not enough for they or the child in the family non english speech non english speech she tell I that her little sister year old elene who be actually the young person shelter with they be hungry all the time she be go to sleep cry and wake up cry and she love milk but they run out of milk more than month ago so what they have be do be basically give she expire juice it be actually not even juice it be a concentrated juice that they would mix with water because it be expire it be make she sick but that be the only thing that they could give she in place of milk when they be able to they would give her sugar cane that they would find in the market and lemon as a snack sometimes when those be not even available they would just give her gum to chew on and stop cry to silence her hunger non english speech so I ask she if they have be able to get any aid since the war start she tell I that her brother muhammad who be year old have be go to the distribution site and sleep on the beach just wait for aid he would leave at in the morning and come back at am he sleep there for day this week so her brother have be sleep on the beach in hope that there would be aid drop off here so what happen so after wait for hour near the distribution site on thursday he see the truck come and along with the crowd he run towards they suddenly when the chaos erupt he just start see people drop to the ground he be actually deaf and mute so he do not know what be happen he just see people get shoot and fall to the ground in front of he she tell I that he see someone get shoot in the head right next to he god in the middle of all the chaos and the bloodshed he be actually able to grab a bag of flour he just take it and start run really fast he be just try to get away and hold on to that bag of flour that he be able to get while leave the site he see this little kid who be also able to grab a bag of flour but she say that he tell she that the kid be stop by local gang member who have attack he and grab the bag of flour from he they steal it from he ghada  brother just keep run until he get home finally he come home after day of sleep in the sand with a bag of flour god a terrifying night mhm but that be the time they have have flour in month since december basically so obviously they want to make bread but that bag be a kilogram bag of flour again they be people shelter in apartment so they have to make it last they as long as possible so it could feed all the member of the family so actually what they be do now be they be mix the flour with animal feed still they be do cup of flour with cup of animal feed to stretch it out for as long as possible they be make bread with it wow she say that it be well but still not normal bread it be not what they be crave non english speech they have be through so much since the war start they have see people kill they have see dead body they have be displace time they have lose friend and family member but she say that now with the hunger and the starvation in the north it be really the bad thing they have go through since the beginning of the war she say that she be see people kid who be rummage through trash try to find anything to eat so she say that people be still go back to that same distribution site she even say that more people be go back on the beach and waiting and camping out and sleep there hope for more aid to come she also say that her brother muhammad be also go back every day since thursday hope to get another bag of flour because he be so hungry that he want to eat anything and risk his life for a bag of flour be worth it despite the fact that so many people have die on thursday try to get flour the fact that some people do come home with a bag of flour that be enough for they and other to go back there in hope that more be go to come non english speech non english speech non english speech hiba thank you thank you sabrina over

be sabrina tavernise see you tomorrow transcript this transcript be create use speech recognition software while it have be review by human transcriber it may contain error please review the episode audio before quote from this transcript and email transcript nytime com with any question from the new york times I be sabrina tavernise and this be the daily late last week an effort to get food into northern gaza turn deadly as thousand of desperate gazan descend on aid truck and israeli troop task with guard those truck open fire but exactly how people die and who be responsible remain contest today my colleague hiba yazbek on what we know about what happen and what it tell we about hunger in gaza it be tuesday march so hiba we be now in the month of israel  war against hamas in gaza and for week we have be hear about negotiation over a cease fire and a hostage exchange then late last week there be a disaster surround an aid convoy that be bring into gaza you have be report on what happen tell we about it so last thursday there be a deadly disaster involve civilian possibly the deadly disaster since the war start nearly month ago in which palestinians be kill and more than be wound in gaza city but there be conflicting report on how they die and what exactly happen the israeli military have account of what happen and the gaza health ministry and witness have another account so my colleague and I start dig into the detail we start call people piece together a picture of what have actually happen there and what do you find when you guy start really look into this so let I just give you the context of what happen this happen in northern gaza the place that have be at war the long that be where israeli ground force begin their invasion of the gaza strip many people have leave the north but we do know that some people be still there the people who have remain there be really live through very desperate condition very little aid have come in to the north of gaza since the war start and especially in recent week food be barely available for the people who have remain there the un have be warn of a famine that be loom over the territory hiba why be there so little aid get into northern gaza in particular well of all there be less aid get into the gaza strip in general not just the north there be multiple reason as to why that be but of the main reason be that israel itself have be very slow to approve permit and often deny permit for aid truck and aid convoy to come in specifically to the north because israel say that they do not want the aid to end up in the hand of hamas that they do not want they to get a hold of the package get it when israel do approve the permit and the aid truck start their journey there be multiple hurdle that they have to go through in order to actually deliver it to the people some of these hurdle include the widespread destruction in gaza there be vast damage across the gaza strip road have be destroy there be rubble everywhere and it be very difficult for the truck to actually move through that rubble and through those road then these aid convoy have to go through multiple israeli checkpoint on the way there be often significant delay at these checkpoint by israeli soldier who be inspect the aid this make it hard for the truck to make it from where they enter in the south all the way to the north in the specific safety window that they be give sometimes they make it halfway through and they turn around because they get delay so much that they can not keep go hm but there be a particular problem with the north where fighting have be go on the long the civil order be now break down essentially we know that frequent israeli strike on palestinian policeman mean that there be really no to run security for official group and for aid convoy leave they vulnerable to attack by local gang who be try to steal the aid and sell it or profit off of it and also hungry and desperate civilian who be try to grab the aid and take as much as they can which mean that they end up steal some of it loot some of it while it be still on the way right so it be lawlessness and effectively social order breakdown I mean this be kind of the downstream effect of extended war in a particular place there be a power vacuum that situation can be very difficult for an organization like the united nations to be able to operate safely right the few aid truck that do come in have have to either suspend their aid delivery into the north or have not be able to deliver aid there the last time unrwa the un agency in charge of palestinian refugee try to bring truck to the north be nearly a month ago but they say that of their convoy come under fire another major aid provider the world food program say that they have not deliver aid there in over week they cite all of the reason we talk about for this suspension so while aid have not be come into the north people have be grow more desperate and hungry and the situation there have be get bad which have be raise international alarm there be be increase call on israel to let aid go through to the north and to alleviate the suffering of the resident there so israel partner with these local palestinian businessman in gaza and they promise to secure the aid convoy that the businessman would supply and that would make their way into the north they successfully do this time last week so people start be very hopeful that more would come and ahead of the delivery they start to gather at this distribution point right outside of gaza city in the north that bring we to thursday  incident music play so last thursday around am around aid truck reach this distribution point they start get close to the crowd of people who have camp there overnight wait for this aid to come when the people see the truck come they be very desperate they surround they they get on top of they then at some point israeli soldier start fire shot then it turn violent very fast it end with palestinians dead and injure this be where the account diverge ok so let us start with the israeli account what do they say happen so the israeli military say that it be try to secure the convoy and it have tank nearby to make sure that the convoy reach the area it do acknowledge that its troop have open fire at the crowd but they say that they open fire when a violent crowd or a violent mob approach their troop and endanger their life they say the shot that be fire be not really the reason why so many people die but the reason that so many people die be because in the chaos of all of it they trample each other and many have die from suffocation or trampling and also that the truck have run over some of the people who be try to run away oh god so the israelis do not deny actually shoot but they say it be more about control the crowd kind of as warn shot type thing and that this be not the way people actually die they say the way people actually die be suffocation or be crush by the aid truck themselves right what do the gazan health authority say so the gazan health authority have actually be call this the flour massacre or the massacre of the hungry stomach because what they be say be that israeli force fire at a crowd of hungry and desperate people who be wait for aid witness and palestinians who be there have say that although some people be trample and possibly run over by the truck that be not the main reason for the high death toll most of the people who be injure or kill be injure and kill by israeli fire so the gazan health authority be essentially say this be a massacre by israel right do we know hiba what actually do happen what have you guy find in your reporting well the israeli military release drone footage that it claim show a mass stampede in which gazan be trample but that video only add to the confusion of the sequence of event the quality and the length of the clip make it more difficult to confirm these claim right it be just grainy there be no sound you see people scramble and run but you do not understand why right the drone footage be heavily edit it leave out key moment but it do show hundred of people circle around the truck and hope to catch a bag of flour then suddenly we see people start to panic and run in multiple direction then they release another clip in which we see israeli tank that be position about a quarter mile down the road then we see about a dozen body lie around they we see people crawl and duck for cover crowd noise but we do have another video that be release by al jazeera gunfire and it show a crowd near the aid convoy and it also capture the sound of gunfire and show multiple tracer round which be a special type of ammunition that help troop fine tune their target when it be d

NY-T 558,I c c prosecutor request warrant for israeli and hamas leader for more audio journalism and storytelling download new york times audio a new ios app available for news subscriber transcript this transcript be create use speech recognition software while it have be review by human transcriber it may contain error please review the episode audio before quote from this transcript and email transcript nytime com with any question from the new york times I be sabrina tavernise and this be the daily music play early this week the top prosecutor of the international criminal court request arrest warrant for israel  prime minister and its defense minister the move shock israelis and set up a possible showdown between the world  top criminal court and israel together with its big ally the united states today my colleague jerusalem bureau chief patrick kingsley explain music play it be thursday may music play so patrick early this week there be a pretty surprising announcement by the international criminal court in the hague it have to do with israel and hamas tell we what happen well on monday morning we be all take by surprise by an announcement from the chief prosecutor at the icc the international criminal court the top criminal court in the world it try individual accuse of war crime and the chief prosecutor announce that he be request arrest warrant for individual involve in the war between israel and hamas for crime against humanity of they be from hamas yahya sinwar the head of hamas within gaza the hamas military commander and the political leader of hamas who be base in qatar but maybe the big news in this announcement be that the chief prosecutor be seek the arrest of of israel  top leader benjamin netanyahu the prime minister and yoav gallant the defense minister and this be a massive bombshell these man be leader from a major us ally they be in regular contact with the us government and they be be implicitly equate with the top leader of an organization hamas that many consider a terrorist organization and this equation send shockwave through israeli society and indeed around the world so this be absolutely remarkable patrick I mean I for be quite surprised by see this I want to dig into it with you so who be this prosecutor behind these request for these warrant and how do he reach this decision to go for they in the place so the prosecutor  name be karim khan and he be a british lawyer a british barrister he be he be lead a very impressive career he have spend year work on human right case both defend people and also prosecute in such case he be involve in tribunal relate to the war surround the breakup of the former yugoslavia rwanda he investigate islamic state crime in iraq and in he be appoint the top prosecutor at the icc and what be his responsibility as top prosecutor well it be his job to travel the world and investigate allegation of human right abuse war crime crime against humanity and in the process play a key role in decide who get prosecute at the international criminal court the icc and the icc prosecutor investigate and try people who would not be pursue by the judicial system within their country of origin it step in when it seem like the domestic authority in any give country be not do their job and last year he famously go after president putin in russia in connection with the war in ukraine so at what point do this prosecutor karim khan turn his attention to israel and gaza well he actually inherit an investigation from his predecessor that be look at israel  conduct and also that of hamas during a previous war in between the side but then that get supersede on october by the horror that we see that day commit by hamas and then by the scale and damage cause by israel  bombing campaign in its counterattack and we begin to see not only revulsion and horror at what hamas have do in early october but also grow criticism and condemnation of what israel and its air force do in its response you will remember that early this year the international court of justice a separate court also in the hague begin to address claim that israel be and be commit a genocide in gaza a claim that israel strongly deny right that be the case that south africa bring we do an episode about that yes exactly so as the world  attention focus on this new conflict so do karim khan  also today the international criminal court  chief prosecutor karim khan qc have wrap up a visit to israel and the occupy west bank khan have visit the region to investigate if war crime be commit on october we start to see he arrive in israel visit some of the site that hamas attack last year talk to survivor talk to leader review security camera footage and so on I have just come from the border of the rafah crossing and we could see gaza at least we could see crane that be on the territory of gaza and he also visit the rafah cross between egypt and gaza talk to palestinians at the ministry of justice in ramallah the chief prosecutor of the world  high court he go to the israeli occupy west bank to ramallah where the palestinian authority be base build up evidence that lead to this announcement on monday music play today I be file application for warrant of arrest before pre trial chamber i of the international criminal court and he make this very dramatic announcement in a video my office have diligently collect evidence and interview survivor and eyewitness at the scene of at least major attack location flank on each side by of his deputy I have reasonable ground to believe that senior leader of hamas yahya sinwar mohammed deif and ismail haniyeh bear criminal responsibility for the follow international crime and the accusation that he make against the hamas leader focus on the violent action that hamas take on october extermination as a crime against humanity murder as a crime against humanity and he walk through a long list of charge stem from the extraordinary violence during that attack the taking of hostage as a war crime rape and other act of sexual violence during captivity and he say there be reasonable ground to believe that hostage take from israel have be subject to sexual violence include rape while be hold in captivity and he cite assessment of medical record video and documentary evidence as well as interview with victim and survivor and I repeat and underline my call for the immediate release of all hostage take from israel and for their immediate safe return to their family so this prosecutor see the atrocity on october and then what follow with hama take the hostage abuse they as crime against humanity that be what it amount to in his view exactly and what about the charge against the israelis these be slightly different israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and minister of defense yoav gallant bear criminal responsibility for the follow international crime obviously a lot of the outcry and horror at the war in gaza have center around israel  airstrike that have kill ten of thousand of gazan but karim khan focus not on the military action of benjamin netanyahu and yoav gallant his defense minister but on the accusation of starvation of civilian as a method of warfare starvation the idea that israel have allegedly seek to restrict and block aid delivery food supply to gaza with the intent to starve the civilian population there these individual through a common plan have systematically deprive the civilian population of gaza of object indispensable to human survival and that be primarily base on the fact that for the week of the war until october or so israel block all aid entry to gaza after yoav gallant the defense minister of these israelis whose arrest mr khan seek say that he be impose a total siege on gaza no food no fuel no electricity and while that total siege be ease towards the end of october khan also note that there have be continue restriction on essential supply like food and medicine ever since that conduct take place alongside attack that kill civilian the obstruction of aid delivery by humanitarian organization and attack on aid worker that force many of those same humanitarian organization to either cease operation or limit their life save effort in gaza the implication be that the famine that he say be present in some area of gaza and imminent in other area be in part the responsibility of netanyahu and gallant that starvation have cause and continue to cause death malnutrition dehydration and profound suffering among the population my office charge netanyahu and gallant as co perpetrator and as superior in the commission of these allege crime why be the focus of these charge starvation I mean give that the airstrike as you say be in many way really the focus of this war and certainly the focus of the world  attention on this war the civilian death from the military operation why starvation karim khan do not explain why he focus on starvation rather than israel  military tactic which he mention only in pass but legal expert have say that it be easy to prove that starvation be use as a method of warfare than it be to prove that there have be any specific crime involve in any specific airstrike and that be because under the rule of war and international law it be not necessarily illegal in and of itself to kill civilian during wartime if a military assess with the help of military lawyer that the likely civilian death toll cause by that strike be proportional to the value of the military target then that in many case will be in accordance with the rule of war if a military can prove that sense of proportionality then it be actually quite hard to prove that there be any crime commit in the process so in other word military action be often weigh quite carefully in the case of say a modern military like israel  or the united states there be lawyer that look at these thing it be not necessarily so easy to prove that something be disproportionate and should be consider a crime exactly whereas with the crime of starvation legal expert say that it be potentially easy to prove that there be some wrongdoing there because yoav gallant the israeli defense minister go on record in a public statement and he announce that there would be a total siege on the territory of gaza and that be follow by an action the action of close off gaza  border for the next week and no aid be allow in during that time there be restriction on electricity water fuel as well as food and that be why legal expert think that karim khan have go after israel with the crime of starvation rather than focus on their military operation but I suppose just think about our coverage patrick and the conversation you and I have have famine and starvation and a civilian population in extreme distress trap in a small piece of territory be also not a small thing right that be also something that make sense that the court would be consider absolutely it be a huge thing people do not have to be hit by an airstrike to be live through an absolutely catastrophic situation so these charge really seem to spell bad news for israel and for these israeli leader netanyahu and gallant and it be remarkable because these be man who as you say be some of america  close ally I mean they be you know at the pentagon they be have meeting with president biden and now the chief prosecutor of the icc be say that they be war criminal yes it be a very dramatic moment in the view of some people a turning point and certainly we can say that it be of the harsh rebuke of israel  wartime conduct since october music play but within israel there be be a very different reaction and it be not all bad news for benjamin netanyahu music play we will be right back music play so patrick what do israelis make of this announcement within israel the reaction have be very different whether it be netanyahu  ally or his critic there have be almost uniform outrage that the prosecutor for the icc would make these accusation and it mean that at a time of rise domestic criticism of prime minister netanyahu across the political spectrum with only a very few exception everyone have rally behind netanyahu and gallant despite the fact that netanyahu be increasingly unpopular and even within his own government there have be grow criticism of his wartime strategy for example just day before the prosecutor  announcement of the senior member of his own wartime cabinet benny gantz issue netanyahu with an ultimatum warn he that he would quit the government if he do not spell out a plan for a post war gaza then suddenly the announcement come from karim khan that netanyahu and gallant be under investigation and gantz be of the to come out with a condemnation of karim khan and a defense of the israeli government that be the clear example of how even critic of netanyahu have fall in line circle the wagon and present a united front this be really interesting so this action by the prosecutor have kind of have the effect of actually close division that be start to appear in israeli society effectively bring netanyahu  critic kind of back into his camp or at least make it hard to criticize he exactly and israelis in general feel that israel have always be target unfairly hold to a high standard than many other country and that this be once again another example of that another example of israel be accuse of thing that other country do but get away with and there have be broadly criticism from the israelis of the icc prosecutor the israeli claim be that the icc prosecutor be make a horrible false equivalence between hamas a terrorist organization and israel a democratic state hamas raid israel and launch the bloody attack on jews in a single day since the holocaust israel in the eye of israelis be fight a righteous response to protect their citizen and to win back the liberty of the hostage that be capture on october music play this guy be out to demonize israel he be do a hit job and netanyahu himself articulate some of the clear version of this argument when he go on american television he be create false symmetry false fact and he be do a grave injustice to the international court and he call khan  decision absurd an effort to demonize israel and to hold it to far high standard than any other country he say it would have be as if after that be like say after well I be issue arrest warrant for george bush but also for bin laden arrest warrant have be issue for both osama bin laden and george bush or after in world war ii well I be issue arrest warrant for fdr but also for hitler it be a hit job it be not serious he be out to defame israel and he be also pour gasoline music play the criticism from israelis have be about process the icc be create about decade ago by a treaty more than country have sign that treaty but israel have not and israel contend that the prosecutor do not have the authority therefore to go after israeli political leader israelis also say that khan do not spend enough time assess whether israel be itself investigate these allegation within its own judicial system remember that the icc be a court of last resort it be only suppose to intervene when a domestic judicial system be genuinely not make any effort to investigate the allege crime and israelis be say that khan do not spend enough time investigate gallant and netanyahu the icc prosecutor have spend year investigate allege crime commit during a previous war between israel and hamas but this decision have be issue within just a few month and israelis be say that khan jump the gun in that sense so the israelis be say look we be try to get to it but you just do not give we enough time exactly and they have even say that khan  team be suppose to be come this very week to continue that conversation and assess whether israel be genuinely look into these allegation by itself and that they mislead israel by pretend that they would be make that assessment when in fact all along they be plan to request arrest warrant interesting so for israeli official they be see it as a kind of activist thing as oppose to a neutral judicial decision that be their claim at least the prosecutor  office say that they have try to sincerely engage with israel on this issue but that it be become clear to they that israel do not seriously investigate this kind of crime so you say there be element to this what be the last the and last element be on the content of the claim itself israel flatly deny that it be responsible for the humanitarian crisis in gaza it even deny that there be a famine or that the situation be on the point of a famine it point out all the way in which it have work to get much more aid into gaza since october include open more crossing allow the we to create a pier on the shoreline of gaza it be allow some country to airdrop aid and certainly the amount of aid that have go in recent month have dwarf the amount that be go in october and november and while it accept that its soldier have obstruct and at time even kill aid worker it say that that obscure the fact that it coordinate every day in detail with aid group to facilitate thousand of aid mission every month be not israel  argument that these shipment could also include thing that could be very useful for hamas the group that just kill of its citizen exactly no  disputing least of all israel that israeli official be examine all the aid go into gaza the dispute be about whether that be necessary israel say it be it say that if it do not check then some of these aid convoy might be smuggle in weapon or material that could be use to fight israel to kill israeli civilian and that therefore israel have no choice but to examine some of these good go in again the counterargument be that israel  check be far more stringent than they need to be and end up prevent the entry of everyday item that pose no military threat ok so that be the israeli perspective how do the united states see the prosecutor  request here I mean the us obviously israel  big ally well the american president president biden condemn it in no uncertain term he say the prosecutor  decision be outrageous and he condemn he for draw an implicit equivalence between hamas and the leader of the state of israel and why do biden come out so strongly against the prosecutor we know that humanitarian aid have be a major concern for this administration so why would biden be so opposed to something that really be call out israel for this aid of all because israel be a major ally of the united states and the united states want to show support for its ally of all they fear that this kind of criticism this kind of intervention will actually make israel less rather than more likely to bring the war to a halt because the feeling be that it will make israel more defensive and in turn batten down the hatch the reason be that the united states historically have never be a particular fan of the international criminal court we mention early that israel do not sign the treaty that create the icc well the united states do not do that either and that be in part because american leader fear that have an international global court undermine american sovereignty they think it be the role of the american judicial system to investigate american citizen and there be a fear that with the united states so active militarily in many part of the world that membership of the court involvement in the court could pave the way for american soldier be try for act on behalf of the united states and that could somehow dent american foreign policy goal across the world ok so the united states do not really like this court you know have troop in a lot of place do not want a court swoop in and prosecute they when something go wrong but I guess the question then in my mind patrick be do what this prosecutor be do matter I mean america be not a signatory israel be not a signatory so why be this important well for the time being its meaning be more symbolic than anything else karim khan have not issue an arrest warrant he have request an arrest warrant for these people and judge will now spend week and possibly month decide whether to uphold those request that process can be less than a month in the case of vladimir putin it be just shy of a month president bashir of sudan be issue with a warrant that process take roughly a year when and if they do do that however there will be practical effect if an arrest warrant be issue it mean that any country that be a member of the international criminal court in theory should arrest any of these individual if they enter their territory that include more than country all over the world much of europe latin america africa and so on yes it be true that the united states and israel be not signatory and neither be turkey or qatar of the country where hamas official spend much of their time when they be outside gaza so there will still be place for official on either side of these accusation to travel to but there be lot of other country like france italy both place where benjamin netanyahu travel in the past year where in theory they will not be able to set foot so the negotiation over the war can still continue but if netanyahu travel to france or to italy he could be arrest which be pretty wild yes at least that be the theory the national authority in any give country still have to make a choice about whether they want to follow through with it but would those country perhaps not arrest he out of deference to the united states I think the expectation be that if we get into this scenario then someone like netanyahu simply just would not travel to such a country but the truth be we just do not really know we be enter unchartered water so this be really isolate netanyahu in the world should it go forward yes isolate netanyahu and to some extent israel itself and it have not just practical implication for the physical movement of netanyahu and his defense minister gallant but it also compound israel  relationship with foreign ally it complicate israel  ability to arm itself more country may grow more unwilling to sell israel arm or at least they will face grow pressure because of this decision not to do so and it also could force the country to become ever more reliant on the united states as it become more of a pariah over its action in gaza which of course put the united states in an even tricky position with an ally who be be pretty hard to be friend with of late right and in truth while the practical consequence of this move be still unknown they do in general compound the sense that israel be face more and more diplomatic consequence for its action more than a decade ago a former israeli prime minister warn that israel would face what he call a diplomatic tsunami if its conflict with the palestinians go unresolved music play and it be possible that year later we be start to finally see what he mean israel do still have its supporter many of they but we be also now see during this war a level of criticism that go above and beyond the kind that we have grow use to seeing direct at israel over the year music play in addition to the warrant request we have see this week we have obviously have an extraordinary wave of protest on american campus and elsewhere in the world and early this year we have a watershed moment when the international court of justice begin hear accusation of genocide against israel and this week several european country recognize palestine as a state wow so if the tsunami have not yet arrive we can at least say that the wave be get strong music play patrick thank you thank you music play on wednesday the leader of spain norway and ireland announce that they would recognize an independent palestinian state the move be largely symbolic but raise the concern that if neighboring country follow their lead europe could become a counterweight to the american position that statehood for palestinians should come only from a negotiate settlement with israel music play we will be right back music play here be what else you should know today nikki haley the former united nations ambassador who drop her republican presidential bid in march say on wednesday that she would vote for donald trump but stop short of officially endorse he haley be trump  long stand rival in the primary contest and have carve out an important lane for herself as the voice for voter look for an alternative to the former president her decision on whether to endorse he could play a pivotal role in the race haley have build a formidable network of high dollar donor and a solid base of college educate voter that trump need to win and the city of uvalde texas have reach a settlement with most of the family of child who be shoot by a gunman at robb elementary school in to avert a lawsuit the city promise to overhaul the city  police force create a permanent memorial to the victim and pay $ music play today  episode be

transcript be create use speech recognition software while it have be review by human transcriber it may contain error please review the episode audio before quote from this transcript and email transcript nytime com with any question from the new york times I be sabrina tavernise and this be the daily music play early this week the top prosecutor of the international criminal court request arrest warrant for israel  prime minister and its defense minister the move shock israelis and set up a possible showdown between the world  top criminal court and israel together with its big ally the united states today my colleague jerusalem bureau chief patrick kingsley explain music play it be thursday may music play so patrick early this week there be a pretty surprising announcement by the international criminal court in the hague it have to do with israel and hamas tell we what happen well on monday morning we be all take by surprise by an announcement from the chief prosecutor at the icc the international criminal court the top criminal court in the world it try individual accuse of war crime and the chief prosecutor announce that he be request arrest warrant for individual involve in the war between israel and hamas for crime against humanity of they be from hamas yahya sinwar the head of hamas within gaza the hamas military commander and the political leader of hamas who be base in qatar but maybe the big news in this announcement be that the chief prosecutor be seek the arrest of of israel  top leader benjamin netanyahu the prime minister and yoav gallant the defense minister and this be a massive bombshell these man be leader from a major us ally they be in regular contact with the us government and they be be implicitly equate with the top leader of an organization hamas that many consider a terrorist organization and this equation send shockwave through israeli society and indeed around the world so this be absolutely remarkable patrick I mean I for be quite surprised by see this I want to dig into it with you so who be this prosecutor behind these request for these warrant and how do he reach this decision to go for they in the place so the prosecutor  name be karim khan and he be a british lawyer a british barrister he be he be lead a very impressive career he have spend year work on human right case both defend people and also prosecute in such case he be involve in tribunal relate to the war surround the breakup of the former yugoslavia rwanda he investigate islamic state crime in iraq and in he be appoint the top prosecutor at the icc and what be his responsibility as top prosecutor well it be his job to travel the world and investigate allegation of human right abuse war crime crime against humanity and in the process play a key role in decide who get prosecute at the international criminal court the icc and the icc prosecutor investigate and try people who would not be pursue by the judicial system within their country of origin it step in when it seem like the domestic authority in any give country be not do their job and last year he famously go after president putin in russia in connection with the war in ukraine so at what point do this prosecutor karim khan turn his attention to israel and gaza well he actually inherit an investigation from his predecessor that be look at israel  conduct and also that of hamas during a previous war in between the side but then that get supersede on october by the horror that we see that day commit by hamas and then by the scale and damage cause by israel  bombing campaign in its counterattack and we begin to see not only revulsion and horror at what hamas have do in early october but also grow criticism and condemnation of what israel and its air force do in its response you will remember that early this year the international court of justice a separate court also in the hague begin to address claim that israel be and be commit a genocide in gaza a claim that israel strongly deny right that be the case that south africa bring we do an episode about that yes exactly so as the world  attention focus on this new conflict so do karim khan  also today the international criminal court  chief prosecutor karim khan qc have wrap up a visit to israel and the occupy west bank khan have visit the region to investigate if war crime be commit on october we start to see he arrive in israel visit some of the site that hamas attack last year talk to survivor talk to leader review security camera footage and so on I have just come from the border of the rafah crossing and we could see gaza at least we could see crane that be on the territory of gaza and he also visit the rafah cross between egypt and gaza talk to palestinians at the ministry of justice in ramallah the chief prosecutor of the world  high court he go to the israeli occupy west bank to ramallah where the palestinian authority be base build up evidence that lead to this announcement on monday music play today I be file application for warrant of arrest before pre trial chamber i of the international criminal court and he make this very dramatic
